Now I want you to upgrade this website into a full dynamic system with an Admin Dashboard. Do not change my existing design, colors, layout, or content. Only add what is necessary to make everything dynamic. Follow these exact requirements:
1. Create an Admin Dashboard (admin.html)
Keep the same Qatar color palette (maroon, gold, white, dark gray)
Admin login screen with password from .env variable (ADMIN_PASSWORD)
After login, show 3 sections:
Manage Portfolio Projects
Separate tabs: “Mobile Apps” and “Websites”
Add / Edit / Delete projects
Each project has: title, category, image URL, and link
Manage Services & Pricing Packages
Add / Edit / Delete service packages
Fields: name, description, price
Analytics Dashboard
Daily visitors
Contact form submissions
WhatsApp button clicks
Display using Chart.js
2. Add a Backend API using Node.js + Express
Create a new folder called backend/ with these endpoints:
Public Endpoints
GET /api/projects → return mobile + website projects
GET /api/services → return service packages
POST /api/contact → send consultation form data to email + log analytics event
POST /api/analytics/whatsapp → increment WhatsApp click count
GET /api/analytics/visitors → return visitor count
Admin Endpoints (require password)
POST /api/admin/projects (add project)
DELETE /api/admin/projects (delete project)
POST /api/admin/services (add service package)
DELETE /api/admin/services (delete package)
GET /api/admin/analytics (full analytics dashboard data)
Backend must use:
express
cors
dotenv
JSON storage files (no database)
3. Add JSON Storage Files
Inside a new data/ folder:
projects.json
services.json
analytics.json
Structure example:
{
  "projects": [],
  "services": [],
  "analytics": {
    "2025-01-01": { "visitors": 0, "whatsapp": 0, "contacts": 0 }
  }
}
4. Update Existing Frontend
Modify my current pages ONLY where required:
Portfolio Section
Load “Mobile Apps” dynamically from /api/projects?category=mobile
Load “Websites” from /api/projects?category=web
Services Section
Load service list from /api/services
Contact Form
On submit:
POST to /api/contact
Show success message
Track WhatsApp clicks via /api/analytics/whatsapp
Arabic/English toggle must continue working.
5. DO NOT Change My Design
Keep all layout exactly unchanged
Maintain my color palette
Keep my fonts and spacing
Keep the hero section and all content
Only add IDs/classes needed to make sections dynamic
6. Show Me The Final Folder Structure
Example:
/frontend
   index.html
   admin.html
   style.css
   script.js
   admin.js

/backend
   index.js
   package.json
   .env.example

/data
   projects.json
   services.json
   analytics.json
7. Tell Me Where Each File Should Be Pasted
Explain which files belong in frontend, backend, data, and which need modifying.
8. After Upgrading
Tell me:
How to start the backend
How to test the admin dashboard
How to log in
How data is saved
How analytics works
Make sure nothing from my original UI is removed or redesigned. Only enhance it with full admin + backend capabilities.”
